## Abstract

This project utilizes K-Means clustering to segment mall customers based on their annual income and spending score. By analyzing the Mall Customer dataset, we identify five distinct customer groups, enabling targeted marketing and improved customer experiences.

## Introduction

K-Means clustering is a powerful technique for customer segmentation. In this project, we apply K-Means to the Mall Customer dataset to discover patterns in customer behavior and preferences.

## Methods

### Data Preprocessing

- Imported and explored the Mall Customer dataset.
- Cleaned and prepared the data for clustering.

### Identifying Optimal Clusters

- Utilized the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k=5).

### K-Means Clustering

- Applied K-Means clustering to the dataset.
- Visualized customer clusters based on annual income and spending score.

## Results

- Successfully segmented mall customers into five distinct groups.
- Enhanced marketing strategies and customer engagement opportunities.

### Customer Clusters

- Cluster 0: High income, high spending score
- Cluster 1: Moderate income, moderate spending score
- Cluster 2: Low income, low spending score
- Cluster 3: Low income, high spending score
- Cluster 4: High income, low spending score

## Discussion

K-Means clustering offers valuable insights into customer behavior, helping businesses tailor their marketing and service offerings.

## Conclusion

By applying K-Means clustering to the Mall Customer dataset, we have efficiently categorized customers into distinct groups. This enables businesses to implement targeted marketing campaigns and deliver personalized shopping experiences.
